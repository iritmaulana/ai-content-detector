# 🧠 AI Content Detector for Laravel

A Laravel-based web service to detect whether text is written by a human or generated by AI — combining OpenAI's GPT models with linguistic forensic techniques.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

-   🔍 **Detects AI-generated text** at sentence and document level
-   🧠 **Linguistic Forensics**: Analyzes tone, fluency, originality, coherence, and structure
-   📊 **Confidence Score & Classification Scale** from _Very Unlikely_ to _Likely AI-generated_
-   🌐 **Web UI**: Simple and intuitive interface built for quick testing
-   ⚙️ **Laravel-based architecture**: Easy to integrate, customize, and scale

---

## 🖼️ Demo UI

The web interface allows users to:

-   Paste any block of text
-   Click **Analyze** to run detection
-   View a **probability score** with a color-coded classification:

| Classification                | Probability Range | Color       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| ✅ Very Unlikely AI-generated | 0–20%             | Green       |
| ✅ Unlikely AI-generated      | 20–40%            | Light Green |
| ⚠️ Unclear if AI-generated    | 40–60%            | Yellow      |
| ⚠️ Possibly AI-generated      | 60–80%            | Orange      |
| ❌ Likely AI-generated        | 80–100%           | Red         |

### 🔍 How It Works

Our AI detector analyzes your text using advanced linguistic forensics to identify patterns that distinguish human writing from AI-generated content. The analysis considers:

-   Linguistic patterns and sentence structures
-   Content depth and originality
-   Stylistic variability
-   Logical flow and coherence
-   Technical and structural indicators
-   Contextual and conceptual depth

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    composer install
    npm install && npm run dev
    ```
3. Configure `.env`:

    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
    ```

4. Add to `config/services.php`:

    ```php
    'openai' => [
        'api_key' => env('OPENAI_API_KEY'),
    ],
    ```

5. Serve the app:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

## 🧪 Usage (Programmatically)

```php
use App\Services\AIDetectorServiceNew;

$detector = new AIDetectorServiceNew();

$result = $detector->analyze("Insert your text here...");
dd($result);
```

## 📈 Classification Scale

1. **Very Unlikely AI-generated (0–20%)**  
   Strong human markers detected, such as personal anecdotes, unique word choices, emotional shifts, and natural inconsistencies.

2. **Unlikely AI-generated (20–40%)**  
   The text appears mostly human-written, but minor AI-like traits suggest some level of AI assistance.

3. **Unclear if AI-generated (40–60%)**  
   The text contains a mix of human and AI traits, making classification ambiguous.

4. **Possibly AI-generated (60–80%)**  
   The text displays multiple AI-like features, such as overly structured formatting and generic phrasing.

5. **Likely AI-generated (80–100%)**  
   Strong AI indicators detected: highly structured, unnatural consistency, and lack of personal engagement.
